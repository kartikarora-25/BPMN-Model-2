**Student Advising BPMN Model**

This repository contains a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram that represents the Student Advising Process in an academic setting. The model maps out the interactions between the Student, Program Area Admin, and Program Chair, detailing how advising requests are processed and scheduled.

**Key Processes in the BPMN Model:**

**Student Request:** A student requires academic advising and contacts the program area.
**Meeting Scheduling:** The program admin checks the chairâ€™s availability and schedules a meeting if possible.
**Approval & Updates:** If the chair is available, the meeting is booked, and the schedule is updated. Otherwise, alternatives are considered.
**Preparation & Response:** Both the student and program chair prepare for the meeting, and the final status is communicated.

This BPMN model provides a structured representation of the advising workflow, aiding in process optimization, automation, and administrative efficiency.
